wouldnt worry whether prefer messaged one network otheryou imagine many simple experience like person discovers business instagram easily transition preferred messaging app secure payment customer support another person want catch friend send message preferred app without think person prefers reached simply post story day across facebook instagram get reply friend one placeyou already send receive text messenger android today wed like extend future perhaps including new telecom rcs standard however several issue well need work possible first apple doesnt allow apps interoperate device wed able android second wed need make sure interoperability doesnt compromise expectation encryption people already using whatsapp finally would create safety spam vulnerability encrypted system let people send message unknown apps safety security system couldnt see pattern activitythese significant challenge many question require consultation discussion implement give people choice use preferred service securely reach people wantpeople want know data stored securely place trust looking future internet privacy believe one important decision well make well build data center store people
